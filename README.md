# Java-Drawing

This program is a very simple drawing program made to show the very basics of how shapes are created using numbers (i.e. x-axis, y-axis, length, height)

Right now this is a work in progress.

This is supposed to be used with processing with Eclipse.

I am somewhat new to the Java language and any help or suggestions from more experienced programmers would be helpful.

As of right now only rectangles can be made.

Thank You,
